## Learn how to recognize a color

1. Generate plot image with just one curve

2. Load the image and create the mask

3. Generate more complex plot image with several additional curves, different backgrounds, extra labels / ticks, grid, etc.

- Generate training set

- Raw input set
image0001.png
image0001.mask1 -> list of pixels
image0001.mask2 
image0001.mask3
image0001.json -> { mask1 = #xxxx, mask2 = #xxxx, mask3 = #xxxx }

- Specific set -> e.g 9x9 patches, centered on the mask pixels +- 3 pixels of margin
			   -> can add data augmentation at that stage

- training -> load all the 9x9 patches + label

## Learn how to segment a given color

Similar input set

Color is given. Find the mask.

## Alternative: do not estimate the color first. Directly give the patch and ask to segment the CG drawed stuff on the input image
